# Generalized Linear Regression to Predict NFL Team Wins
Introduction to your project, such as background and identified problems

We used a Generalized Linear Regression Model to predict the number of games won by different NFL teams in different seasons based on various statistics with data taken from the ESPN website. We chose this topic because we are both interested in sports and the increasing prevalence of analytics used in professional sports. Our initial problem was to find out which factors and which models best predict a team's performance, measured in the amount of games won.
